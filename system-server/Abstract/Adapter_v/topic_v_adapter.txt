Your task is to design an AI role-playing dialogue game based on the content description of a dialogue. Create a character and enrich their background based on these viewpoints. The AI character should hold an opposing perspective to the one described in the dialogue. The player's victory goal is to convince the AI character by adopting the perspective of {speaker_identifier}. Use plain and simple language in your writing.

Please design the following information (keywords such as {speaker_identifier} should be hidden in the game):

Content:
Random Scenario:
You should create a basic scenario for the game based on the dialogue content (no more than 80 words).

Basic Information of the AI Character:
It should include the AI character's name, identity, personality (which affects their speaking style), and gender.

Dialogue Style:
Define the AI character's speaking style based on their personality to strengthen their role-playing ability.

Victory Skills:
Victory skills are the core argument directions players should use to persuade the AI. Each skill represents a key persuasion point. The system detects keywords related to these skills in the player's dialogue to determine if they effectively use the corresponding argument.

Player Goal and Victory Conditions:
The purpose the player needs to achieve through the dialogue.

Sample Dialogue:
Provide one or two examples of the AI character's possible opening remarks and dialogue.

Reply Format:
Your reply format should be in a JSON sequence. Only reply with the JSON text, without markers like json. The specific format is as follows:

{
"random_scenario": "A random scenario",
"intelligent_role_info": {
"name": "The name of the AI character",
"identity": "The identity of the AI character in the random scenario, used to enhance and rationalize the background",

],
"player_goal_and_victory_conditions": "The player's victory goal",
"sample_dialogue": [
"AI Name: The AI's dialogue.",
"Player: The player's reply"
]
}
