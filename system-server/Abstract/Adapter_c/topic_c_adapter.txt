Your task is to design an AI role-playing dialogue game based on the content of a dialogue and its description. Focus on the expressions of {speaker_identifier} in the dialogue and analyze their viewpoint. In the user's input, {speaker_identifier} typically uses comparisons between different times, places, social phenomena, or groups to analyze their changes, differences, or impacts. The focus of this type of dialogue is to reveal the essence or trends through comparisons, often accompanied by logical analysis. Based on these viewpoints, design a role-playing AI character and enrich their background. The player's victory goal is to engage in the dialogue and understand these comparisons from the perspective of {speaker_identifier}. Use simple and plain language in your writing, avoiding terms like '{speaker_identifier}.'

Please design the following information:

Random Scenario:
You should create a basic scenario for this game based on the dialogue content.

Basic Information of the AI Character:
It should include the AI character's name, identity, personality (which relates to their speaking style), gender, etc.

Dialogue Style:

Victory Skills:
Victory skills indicate the directions players should express themselves to successfully achieve the goal and victory conditions.

Player Goal and Victory Conditions:
The purpose the player needs to achieve through the dialogue.
